This project is a menu-driven Java application that simulates a basic hospital management system. It allows the hospital staff to manage patient records efficiently, including adding new patients, updating details, viewing information, and removing records. 
The program leverages OOP concepts, custom exceptions, and collections (HashMap, List) to handle data securely and systematically.

Learning Objectives :
Understand and apply OOP concepts like encapsulation and abstraction.
Implement custom exceptions for data validation and error handling.
Use Java Collections (HashMap, ArrayList) to manage records dynamically.
Build a menu-driven console app for real-world hospital-like operations.

In short: This program acts as a mini hospital management system, helping to handle patient data (add, update, view, remove) in a structured and secure way, while demonstratin
